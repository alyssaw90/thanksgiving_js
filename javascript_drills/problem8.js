/*compress(string)
Use a pattern and consolidate the amount 
of characters into a simplified string.
If a character is represented more than once, 
append the number of occurences in front of it. 
If a chracter is only represented once, 
just put that letter. Hint Use a loop to iterate over 
a string. You can reference characters in a string 
similar to an array. */
