//compress(string)
//Use a pattern and consolidate the amount of characters into a simplified string
//If a character is represented more than once, append the number of occurences in front of it. If a chracter is only represented once, just put that letter
//Hint Use a loop to iterate over a string. You can reference characters in a string similar to an array.
